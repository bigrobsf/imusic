# iMusic Search

We had an assignment to build a little app using jQuery and Ajax as part of the pre-work for my next class. iMusic Search accepts an artist or group name as a search parameter and checks the iTunes API for the ID of the artist. If found, it then looks up albums associated with the artist ID and returns them, displaying each album as a div in the browser ordered by release date.

The album information includes the number of tracks, which when clicked will display the track names ordered by track number.

Finally, when the user selects an album's track name, a modal will pop up that plays a preview of the track from iTunes.
